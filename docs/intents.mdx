# Intents

**Intents** are a type of design token that have a strict definition and construction; they are _truly semantic_.

> #### What is "truly semantic"?
>
> This is a difficult question to answer however, there are a few quailites that we can consider.
> - **Semantic tokens avoid scales.** This is the "smedium" problem. You should be able to add and remove truly semantic tokens because they have very few relations to each other.
> - **Semantic tokens are easily placed.** Finding a token called `action.primary.backgroundColor` more clearly describes _where_ or _when_ the token is expected to be used. In contrast, the token `color.blue.500` does not convey any information about where or when it should be used.
> - **"Component Tokens" are often highly specific semantic tokens.** A component token is describing the characteristics of a specific component. The best case scenario is generalizing these into categories for more reuse; which is the fundamental strategy behind intents.

### Anatomy

The construction of an intent commonly has three (3) parts: **purpose, priority, property**.

#### Purpose

The first part of the intent name is the **purpose**, which is a generalized user interface concept with a known user expectation. There are four (4) main categories of purpose:

- **surface** describes regions where content is placed. This covers modals, cards, dropdowns and even the whole page. These are commonly non-interactive.
- **action** describes interactive content typically executed by the user with a tap or click; a canonical button.
- **control** describes interactive regions where the user is expected to enter a value.
- **text** describes all text using only font specific properties. Colors are associated with other above purposes.

#### Priority
At first, the concept of **priority** seems to break the first quality of being semantic; including a scale. However, in this model, the scale is describing the importance of the user interface concept to the user. There are three (3) levels of priority:

- **primary** describes the most important thing that the user should read or interact with on the page. For text, these are headlines. For actions, these are primary buttons. For surfaces, these are typically modals or other treatments meant to strictly focus the user's attention in a modal-like way.
- **secondary** describes the next most important thing after primary. For text, this is body copy. For actions, these are the secondary buttons. For surfaces, these are regions created for flyouts as the user has deliberately chosen to interact with these apart from the rest of the experience when they exist.
- **auxiliary** describes less important things. For text, this is detail for help messages or legal copy. For buttons, these are the most simply designed but also most commonly found in an experience. For surfaces, this describes the body of the page and its stylistic properties.

Note that **auxiliary does not mean default**. This is especially the case for text. What is considered the default priority for component usage depends on the purpose. In the case of the `text` component, the default is secondary. This is because the body copy is expected to be more common than smaller details for passive information.

> #### What about priority for control?
>
> The control category doesn't include priority levels because user input isn't seen with priority; all controls are equally important. You may argue that an input showing an error state is more important than another without, however we'll handle this treatment in another way.

#### Property

From here, the last part describes the stylistic property being changed. The available properties depend on the category but in general, the **surface**, **action**, and **control** categories handle properties like color, rounding, and stroke. The **text** category handles all font related properties. In most cases, these are directly related to CSS properties. In fact, the construction of an intent is similar to CSS declaration syntax.

```css
/* purpose.priority */
button.primary {
    /* property */
    background-color: blue;
}
```

> #### What about state?
>
> States such as `:disabled` or `:hover` are handled with changes internal to the system and its components. This is to reduce the amount of curation required to assign values to all the intents. Especially values which are less frequently seen.
>
> For the concept of `:disabled`, the component is presented at `opacity: .4` and `cursor: not-allowed`. For buttons, the concept of `:hover` is handled by mixing the given background and foreground colors by a small percentage to show feedback to the user, along with `cursor: pointer`.
>
> As mentioned earlier, the concept of `:invalid` is handled differently since it is considered of an expression that doesn't change the functionality of the page (ie., `:disabled`), nor is it trigged directly by the user (ie., `:hover`).

#### Examples of intents

- `text.primary.fontFamily` describes the font family for headlines.
- `action.secondary.borderColor` describes the border color for secondary buttons.
- `control.backgroundColor` describes the background color for input fields.
- `surface.auxiliary.foregroundColor` describes the color of body copy and icons.

### Additional intents

There are other categories of intents that should be addressed for completeness.

#### Figure

The **figure** category has a purpose which describes regions of the same concept meant to be visually segregated (eg., charts, illustrations, default avatar colors, syntax highlighting, etc.).

The tokens in this category have no meaning past segregated color. In other words, the first slice of a pie chart is too specific of a concept to have a token named for it. Instead, we provide a collection of tokens meant to cover this regions generally where they are identified using a scale. This is appropriate because the meaning of the color being used isn't attached to the region. The region doesn't have meaning past existing as a colored region next to other colored regions.

An example of a figure color token is `figure.rank1.color`. While this does follow the general anatomy of the common intents, there are some slight differences.

The priority is less about importance to the user, and more about how frequently we expect to see this color in the region. Imagine a color-by-number book where the colors are ranked in terms of expected frequency of use for the entire book. We then use that ranking to assign the numbers to the regions where we expect the color.

The property of color is used to ambiguate the use. For cases such as charts and illustrations, it is possible that the color is used for a background fill. For syntax highlighing, this could be used as the text color.

> #### Is it appropriate for the same set of colors to be used for all these regions?
>
> Possibly not. The general idea is that there will be a set of branded colors that an organization will want to included in visual regions within the experience. In the event more fine-tuned decisions need to be made for these regions, component tokens could be introduced as `chart.rank1.color` and `avatar.rank1.color`.

#### Space

The **space** category is unique since is meant to convey the intention of relationships using the void between objects, not affecting the objects themselves. This category has only two intents:

- `space.minDimension` describes the smallest amount of space that will exist within the experience.
- `space.scaleFactor` describes the rate in which the spacing scale will increase.

The resulting amount of space is further determined by a formula using the depth of the current scope. For more about this technique, see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).

### Curating values

The act of selecting values to associate with an intent is called **curation**. As described earlier, the name of the intent should provide a clear indication about where or when the token is meant to be used within an experience, typically a group of similar components or user expectations.

This section will mention parts of intents that are less immediately clear.

#### foregroundColor

The concept of `foregroundColor` is meant to cover **text and icons**. You can consider both of these collections of glyphs which align to having the same color between them. This is similar to setting `<svg fill="currentColor"/>` to inherit the text color in code. This is included in surface, action, and control categories.

When curating the `foregroundColor` you should consider this decision along with the `backgroundColor` for the current intent. For example, the `action.primary.foregroundColor` **should always exist** on top of the `action.primary.backgroundColor`. As an incorrect example, the `ACTION.secondary.foregroundColor` **should not exist** on top of a `SURFACE.secondary.backgroundColor` as they are in separate categories of intents. This connection exists for accessibility; to ensure adequate contrast with each pairing.

You should also consider the `borderColor` with this set as well, but is less critical from an accessibility standpoint. Best practice is to work on curating each set at a time; all `action.primary` colors, then all `action.secondary` colors and so on.

#### minDimension, minRem, & scaleFactor

The text and space categories compute sizing scales for their respective purposes. In order to create these scales we need two numbers, a starting point and exponential growth from that point to create the scale. The formula looks like this:

```
size = min * pow(scale, level)
```

Where the `level` is determined by the depth. For more on this value, see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).

The `minDimension` expects a value with a unit such as `8px` or `.5rem` to use as the base for further scale calculations. The minimum is used to ensure that the resulting value is never smaller than expected.

The `minRem` represents the smallest font size for that category of text in terms of `rem`. This means expecting to curate a value of `20px` would be expected as `minRem: 1.5` (eg., `1.5rem`).

> #### Why not use `minDimension` for consistency?
>
> To complete the necessary calculations for the text category, every number provided needs to unitless as CSS `calc()` functions can't make unitless ratios from division operations. This may be possible in the future, in which case `minRem` will be replaced with `minDimension`.

The `scaleFactor` is used to create the exponential scale of values for the category to choose from.
