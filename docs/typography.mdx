# Typography

### Categories
There are three categories of typography:

- Heading: Used for titles.
- Body: Used for most content.
- Detail: Used for auxiliary content.

These values do not change between density contexts. Each value is applied to the entire category. This helps reduce the number of decisions needed to customize a theme. For example, this keeps the number of fonts loaded at a maximum of 4; one for each category.

### Font size
The font sizes steps are calculated using the [Major Third scale (1.25)](https://type-scale.com/) against the theme's standard font size. This scale allows for a noticable progression without exaggerated results. In other words, each step relates well to the next for content hierarchy.

### Relation to density
The typography scale is related directly to density is used to calculate the font size for each category varying by the density context. In other words, as the density gets tighter, the font sizes for each category are reduced by one step of the scale.

### Avoiding vertical rhythm curation
Due to the [line-height box model](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align), there is little consideration for vertical rhythm. With more effort, [the given approach](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align#css-awesome) could be executed, however more metrics would need to be captured and set within the theme for each font used. As another option, if the [leading-trim specification](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/leading-trim-the-future-of-digital-typesetting-d082d84b202) is adopted across modern browsers this can be revisited.
