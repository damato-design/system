# Button

The button comes in several variations depending on the need of the experience.

<button data-priority="primary">Primary</button>
<button data-priority="secondary">Secondary</button>
<button>Default</button>

Remember the [density](foundations/density) of the button can change based on the parents' density shift. The examples below shift the density one level down.

<div data-density-shift>
  <button data-priority="primary">Primary</button>
  <button data-priority="secondary">Secondary</button>
  <button>Default</button>
</div>

If the button only consists of an icon, you may use a square variation.

<button data-square data-priority="primary">
  <liga-icon>thumb_up</liga-icon>
</button>
