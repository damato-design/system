# Compositions

A composition is an example of how components are meant to be used together in a larger construction. This should demonstrate real needs of user-interface designers and developers and how this design system would support those needs. These examples are also meant to inform the architecture of components; helping to identify gaps in supporting layout and expression needs.

## Brand Switching

For the sake of the examples within this section, you can switch between each brand by clicking the logo located in the top corner of the interface. This will expose a dropdown of brands that you can choose from. When selected, the interface will be rebranded.

> #### Why doesn't the treatment look perfect to the referenced brand site?

> There's several factors that will cause the final result to look inadequate. One major reason might be that the system respects the user's preferences, so you may have dark-mode active on your operating system while the brand this is replicating does not have a dark-mode treatment of their website. Other user preferences will influence the final treatment in these examples such that areas where you might expect vivid brand colors are replaced with inclusive alternatives based on the user's preferences.

> #### Why do the layout of these pages look weird?

> As this is a site dedicated to exploration, some of the parts used to make these components are incomplete. A major area of improvement will be how to handle responsive techniques in a systematic way without the need of addressing CSS directly. Even exposing something as simple as a maximum width must be reviewed for necessity.
