# Color

The color system does not include swatches of color and instead focuses on maintaining a contrast between colors and supporting accessible accents. A theme can choose to use the grayscale or accents in whatever combinations that produce suitable contrast for inclusive experiences.

## Grayscale

The color steps of gray follow a [logistic curve](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticEquation.html), meaning they increment exponentially from the gray with the least amount of contrast (ie. the middle gray). The formula to determine the level of gray is the following:

- RGB: 255 / 1 + grayscale<sup>step</sup>, result is the number for each color channel.
- HSL: 100 / 1 + grayscale<sup>step</sup>, result is the percentage of lightness (0% saturation).

Step 0 results in middle gray, each step either goes toward black (ultragray) or white (infragray). The grayscale value is where curation occurs as we can tune this to have more or less contrast between the grays. The higher the grayscale value, the more contrast between infragray and ultragray (which also results in less contrast between grays on the same side of the scale). You can see the effect of the value with the range control below.

In choosing these shades, accessibility is a priority. With the layout colors selected at opposite ends of the scale, this ensures that if a gray on one side appears as text on top of a gray on the other side. The text should pass accessibility standards (assuming the font size is appropriate).

While there are now [different standards between AA and AAA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) which also relate to font size, a general rule is to ensure a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between the background color and text. Throughout the site, this ratio is typically much higher. You can use the colorfield control below to test the ratio between a chosen text color and the current background color of the site. This should also update when changing the system color.

This isn't enough to simply select a high contrast between the background and text. Certain contrasts cause [Irlen Syndrome](https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/) which some people perceive the text to move on the page due to contrast sensitivity. The contrast between grayscale steps was adjusted to mitigate this.

## Accent Colors

Accent colors were chosen first by general hue then by accessibility measurements and finally applied to denote a user interaction or areas of interest. Many of the components that expect the user to take action or provide feedback are indicated using an accent color.

Unlike many other systems, no color is selected to represent something good or bad. [Different colors mean different things to different cultures](https://uxplanet.org/understanding-color-psychology-though-culture-symbolism-and-emotion-215102347276). This could be rectified with localized color theming with a large effort for coverage or by choosing not including color as status. The system expects to use other patterns to help guide the user in understanding a meaning of state.
