# Primitives

Primitives are low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex compositions. In many cases, you can think of them as super-charged HTML elements.

Generally speaking, primitives aren't expected to be used on their own but instead as a part of a larger composition. For example the `input` primitive is practically invisible itself. The more appropriate choice for displaying a user input is to use the `<Field/>` component and add the `input` primitive as a child.

```jsx
<Field>
    <input.text/>
</Field>
```
See visual examples in the [Field component docs](/docs/components-field--docs).

### Priniciples

- Elements should be composable such that no additional styles need to be declared.
- Authors cannot add `id`, `class`, or `style` attributes to any component. These are handled internally to the library as needed and are removed if provided.
