# Primitives

Primitives are low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex compositions. In many cases, you can think of them as super-charged HTML elements.

Generally speaking, primitives aren't expected to be used on their own but instead as a part of a larger composition. For example the `input` primitive is practically invisible itself. The more appropriate choice for displaying a user input is to use the `field` primitive and add the `input` primitive as a child.

```jsx
<field.div>
    <input.text/>
</field.div>
```
See visual examples in the [Field component docs](/docs/components-field--docs).

### Priniciples

- Elements should be composable such that no additional styles need to be declared.
- Authors cannot add `id`, `class`, or `style` attributes to any component. These are handled internally to the library as needed and are removed if provided.

> #### Why choose React over Web Components?
>
> While I am a proponent of web components for their style encapsulation and focus on native 
> DOM methods, the compositional aspect is lacking.
>
> As an example, in order to create a button 
> using web components, you'd either need to update the custom tag to make it semantic through 
> additional attributes or wrap the existing button in a component. Both cases are undesirable 
> from a maintenance perspective. In React, we can have a component alias (ie., `<Button/>`) 
> that renders the native `<button/>` element. If [component built-ins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/is) were widely available, 
> then this would be a more difficult decision.
