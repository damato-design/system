# Design System Playground

This site is meant as an exploration of design system ideas. Some of the approaches found within these pages are highly experimental but remain as a proof of concept for organization and composition of resources within our practice.

The design system...

- Supports designing with intentions, not arbitrary feelings.
- Invokes deliberate restrictions for the purpose of reducing decisions.
- Should aim to fill gaps produced by wireframing and user flows.
- Provides guidance for implementing common patterns and themes.

We believe that proper adoption of a design system suggests a trustworthy experience to the user. If parts of a user flow deviate from expectations with novel concepts, the user will lose trust and patience in the system unless prompted. It is imperative that user expectations are met from the smallest tokens and components which are the foundations to our larger experiences.

> Look out for this visual treatment, it often provides clarity to a newly introduced concept.

User discretion is advised. ðŸ˜Š
