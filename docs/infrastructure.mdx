# Infrastructure

In order for the system to work seamlessly, there are several features in place.

### Mode Schema

You can create a new mode by running the following command:

```sh
npm run write:template
```

This will create a new mode named `newmode.yml` within the `src/modes` directory. Rename the file however you like that aligns to your organizational preference. Note that the best naming conventions explain the purpose of using something over the hinting at the values within.

Each generated `.yml` file will be prefilled with the token structure expected to fully cover an experience. This will also include metadata. The basic top-level setup for this file is as follows:

```yml
mode: # The key to activate the the mode. `<box.div mode="my-mode"/>`
brand: # A string that groups this within a single brand. If not set, this is considered "symbolic". See Color docs for more information.
lang: # A string that represents the language where these values should be applied. (eg., en-US) Leaving this blank will apply the mode in all locales.
tokens: # The token structure which requires curated values.
```

> #### How should `mode` be named?
>
> The `mode` key is important as it is meant to describe the use of this collection of values **across all brands**. This is not necessarily a unique identifier and could be shared across files that have a similar purpose. For example, you could create a mode that is meant to express the concept of premium (`mode: premium`). Then we could use that concept across pages, where each brand could have its own curated "premium" experience. For brands that don't have a concept of premium, the page would be styled in their default curation. Or more accurately, the next available mode found higher in the scope of hierarchy.
>
> **The mode shouldn't attempt to describe the visual style of the region.** It should be named to a purpose or intention for this new mode. The values within the mode will convey the presentation of that purpose.

Importantly, **the file does not need to be completed as provided**. The recommended organization is to have separate modes for color, typography, and spacing. This is because color is more often experimented with than other styles.

> #### Do I need to create separate files for light and dark mode?
>
> No, the system handles light and dark mode by mixing the system color with your given brand color with some amount of influence. The lightness or darkness is determined by the user's settings.
>
> You could force your provided color in place by setting `$influence` to `100` for any color token. This will ensure that your given color is the one used. This might be important for hyper-personalized settings where the user explicitly expects an appearance that is different from what the device normally provides. As an example, a user might prefer dark mode for most tasks, but specifically prefers light mode for reading articles.

The schema should also help the curation process with intellisense within your code editor by using a YAML server extension.

After a new mode is completed, run the following command to create the required assets to start using the new mode:

```sh
npm run write:files
```

This creates the associated `.css` file and updates the inventory of available modes for the Mode Manager to reference in the page lifecycle.

### Mode Manager

To make the system work there is a script that writes resources meant for the `<head/>` of the document. The resources are initialized in the following manner:

```js
import { modeManager } from  './mode-manager.js';

modeManager({ /* options */ })
```

This should be called within the SSR process for the `<head/>` with the following options:

The `sizes` option determines the amount of sizes that this page is meant to display. For more information about this see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).

The `brand` option determines what brand to include in the page. This filters the possible modes that are expected to load to only the brand set. Without setting this value, the page would be presented as unbranded, using system and symbolic colors. Only one brand can be loaded. Brands omitted from this list will not be lazy loaded.

> #### What if I want to support cobranding?
> To keep the complexity of the system to a minimum, the system only accepts a single brand. However, the brand can be updated within the lifecycle. This means while only one brand can be present on the page, which brand this is can be switched at any time.
>
> To support cobranding, where the brands were expected would need to be defined similar to the way a mode is within the composition (eg., `data-brand="target"`).

The `modes` option is an array of mode indentifier strings that should be loaded as soon as possible. This is to set the known modes that the page should present in its first load. The manager will also load modes as they appear within the HTML during the page lifecycle.

The result of the manager will create several resources.

The manager will create a `<style/>` tag which serves two purposes:

1. The CSS includes a node detection setup where as a node is introduced into the page, it triggers an imperceptable animation which is picked up by later scripts.
2. When `sizes` is provided, additional CSS is written to support the given amount.

The manager will create a `<script/>` tag which serves a few purposes:

1. The script will set up a Web Worker and a BroadcastChannel to communicate with the worker. The worker does most of the lookup and filtering of resources on a separate thread than the page.
2. The script handles adding and removing `<link/>` tags that represent the mode CSS depending on the earlier setup and what modes appear over the lifecycle.
3. The script listens for the aforementioned animation to fire on the qualifying selectors. When this occurs, a message is sent to the worker to potentially add a resource to the page.
4. Once the network is idle and the connect is reasonable, there's one last call to retrieve the remaining modes for the given brand since we can expect that they might appear within the experience eventually.

If `modes` were provided, the script will also immediately write resources to the page. These will be `<link/>` tags similar to what will be written in later lifecycles. The difference is that the later script will not remove these. This means that if you set `brand` at the `modeManager`, this brand's resources will always be found on the page.
