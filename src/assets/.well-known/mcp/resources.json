This includes text and icons.\r\n- `borderColor` describes the color that may surround the region.\r\n\r\nThe value applied is a combination of the color and the amount of influence that color should have when being mixed with the system color. In the curation of these values, these are prepared in the following way:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ntokens: \r\n    $action_primary_backgroundColor:\r\n        $value: purple\r\n        $influence: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### Why are the colors for the examples so boring?\r\n>\r\n> The purpose of the examples is meant to focus on composition and less on cosmetic appearance. As such, the mimimum viable curation has been completed to show how color may be applied in the examples.\r\n\r\n### Mixing\r\n\r\nColors are eventually presented in the interface through a mixing system.\r\n\r\n- **User preference** which informs the base layer of perceived lightness for accessible contrast.\r\n- **Brand** which informs the customized presentation to identify branding needs.\r\n- **Symbolic** which enhances specific messaging using color related to the subjective meaning of the content.\r\n\r\n#### User preference\r\n\r\nFirst, the base layer of colors is provided by a [system color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color). As an example, the `Canvas` keyword represents the page background color according to the user's system preferences. This should be a light color in light mode and a dark color in dark mode.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n    background-color: Canvas;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this always a light color for me?\r\n>\r\n> If you're trying this out in your own project, you also need to include `color-scheme: light dark` within a high declaration in the page (eg., `:root`, `html`, `body`).\r\n\r\n#### Brand\r\n\r\nNext, we will introduce the branding to the color using `color-mix()`. The tokens below are generically named in the example to demonstrate the expected values for this area more clearly:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n    --bg: color-mix(\r\n        in oklch,\r\n        oklch(from Canvas l c none),\r\n        oklch(from var(--value) none c h) var(--influence, 100%)\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `color-mix()` function takes three arguments.\r\n\r\nThe first is the color space where we use `oklch` to maintain the perceived luminance of the color as we mix. This is to standardize the contrast of the colors for accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe second argument is returning the perceived lightness for the current `Canvas` and setting the hue to `none`, effectively omitting the color. This is the amount of gray we'll use to inform the lightness of final branded color.\r\n\r\nThe third is the expected page background color provided by the brand and the amount of influence as a percentage that this color is meant to have at this location. Setting the influence to `100%` would cause this color to take over anything provided by the earlier `Canvas` value.\r\n\r\nFor a property like background color, we most likely **do not** expect a large amount of influence to be present. In other areas like buttons, we might expect the influence to be higher.\r\n\r\n> #### Why doesn't my browser devtools recognize this statement?\r\n>\r\n> As of the time of this writing, the relative color syntax for keywords like `Canvas` or `currentColor` is [very new and not well supported](https://caniuse.com/css-relative-colors).\r\n\r\n#### Symbolic\r\n\r\nColor symbolism is the cultural evolution of our psychological associations with color. In some areas of the page, a special mode can be introduced which expects to enhance the current messaging provided by the system in a largely brand agnostic way. An example of this could be when a form field means to display an error. We can leverage a change in color to indicate this area needs special attention.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, we might support this by including additional tokens for a red color intended in certain places to highlight the error. In this system, we consider the area to be a new mode conveying the concept of being in a critical state and affecting the values of the intents within.\r\n\r\nFurthemore, that red color is culturally specific. In other words, the color red might not mean \"danger\" to the person it is presented. In Eastern cultures, the color red means \"prosperity\", which could be considered far from dangerous depending on how it is used. This means that the color being provided here may need to change based on the user's culture to provide an accurate expression.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n[mode=\"system:critical\"]:lang(en-US) {\r\n    --bg: color-mix(\r\n        in oklch,\r\n        oklch(from Canvas l c none),\r\n        oklch(from var(--value) none c h) var(--influence, 100%)\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, the value represented at `--value` provided by the mode could be `red` because the United States expects the color red to convey a critical state. Meanwhile the `--influence` is set to `100%` meaning that the color provided by `--value` is the dominant color and would show in full regardless of what is provided by `Canvas`.\r\n\r\nThe major difference is that modes marked with symbolic color are appended to the page, while normal modes are prepended. This is so symbolic colors are effectively overrides to the brand where appropriate. We set this in a mode by omitting a `brand` in the `.yml` file which indicates that this is curation is meant to exist across brands. The following example also demonstrates including a locale for the mode.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nbrand: my-brand\r\nlang: en-US\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the mode metadata to construct a `:lang()` CSS selector, we provide the appropriate color updated to the scoped mode. We also expect the influence of this value to be much higher due to the expression this attempts to convey.\r\n\r\n> #### Can the brand also be affected by culture?\r\n>\r\n> Yes! It is possible that the chosen brand colors are less effective for certain cultures, so it may be appropriate to curate these values differently. As an example, Eastern cultures don't respond well to black buttons so consider changing the action background color to a more culturally appropriate value.",

This should demonstrate real needs of user-interface designers and developers and how this design system would support those needs. These examples are also meant to inform the architecture of components; helping to identify gaps in supporting layout and expression needs.\r\n\r\n## Brand Switching\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the examples within this section, you can switch between each brand by clicking the logo located in the top corner of the interface. This will expose a dropdown of brands that you can choose from. When selected, the interface will be rebranded.\r\n\r\n> #### Why doesn't the treatment look perfect to the referenced brand site?\r\n>\r\n> There's several factors that will cause the final result to look inadequate. One major reason might be that the system respects the user's preferences, so you may have dark-mode active on your operating system while the brand this is replicating does not have a dark-mode treatment of their website. Other user preferences will influence the final treatment in these examples such that areas where you might expect vivid brand colors are replaced with inclusive alternatives based on the user's preferences.\r\n\r\n> #### Why do the layout of these pages look weird?\r\n>\r\n> As this is a site dedicated to exploration, some of the parts used to make these components are incomplete. A major area of improvement will be how to handle responsive techniques in a systematic way without the need of addressing CSS directly. Even exposing something as simple as a maximum width must be reviewed for necessity.",

      "name": "Density",
      "text": "import { Meta, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';\r\nimport { Primary, Sizes } from '../src/components/Button/index.stories';\r\n\r\n<Meta title=\"Foundations/Density\" />\r\n\r\n# Density\r\n\r\nEverything below is contained within [the `box` primitive](/docs/primitives-box--docs), which is the basis for nearly every component. Read on if you'd like to learn how the final resulting values are determined.\r\n\r\n### Tokens\r\n\r\nBefore reading this, see the [Intents docs](/docs/foundations-intents--docs).\r\n\r\nThere are a few tokens that help describe the concept of density.\r\n\r\n- `$space_minDimension` describes the minimum amount of space that will exist in the experience. It is recommended to use a pixel amount over a relative unit for this value.\r\n- `$space_scaleFactor` describes the rate in which the space values increase over steps.\r\n\r\n> #### Why are pixels recommended for `minDimension`?\r\n>\r\n> This is a matter of accessibility and user preferences. A user may update the font size settings within their operating system to make content eaiser to read. This setting will affect the value representing the `rem` unit (and other font units). When the user increases the font size, they are not typically expecting the space between elements to also increase. This behavior is different from zooming, which scales everything uniformly.\r\n>\r\n> When we use an absolute unit like pixels as the value, the font scaling setting does not affect the space between elements, so compositions are less large than they would be if the value was related to font size. The more compact composition maintains a similar navigation experience than if everything was to grow to the font size causing more overflows and scrolling to be required.\r\n\r\n### Sizes\r\n\r\nThe amount of sizes that can exist on any page is declared at the page, specifically when the Mode Manager is initialized. For more about the Mode Manager, see the [Infrastructure docs](/docs/foundations-infrastructure--docs). This is a unique direction in comparison to many other systems; where sizes are configured on a per-component basis. In this system, _anything_ can be affected by the given `sizes` expected on the page. Importantly `sizes` is **not a token** to be set in a mode, it is declared at each page. Here is an example of the `<Button/>` component where `sizes` was set to `3`.\r\n\r\n<Canvas of={ Primary }/>\r\n\r\n> #### Why are these components so big?\r\n>\r\n> The examples found for most of the components here are displayed with no change in density. This means they are displayed at their largest size. In order to reduce the size of any component, it must exist in a container where `denser` was applied or the `mode=\"system:denser\"`.\r\n\r\nIn order to curate when a change of size should occur, a designer should consider **depth** as it relates to how deep a concept exists within an interface. As an example, a hero banner would be considered at a higher level of depth than a headline within a card. If you can consider the card as a smaller version of a page, it would be like a page is scaled down to exist as a card. This amount of scaling is a level of depth, something like a [Russian nested doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). Here is an example using `<Button/>` with the nested approach.\r\n\r\n<Canvas of={ Sizes }/>\r\n\r\nAnother way to think about this is relative distances. If you consider distance in terms of being near or away, the way we describe a distance will change based on context. If our scope of measuring distance is at the planet level, cities would be considered close together relative to planets. Changing our scope to a single city would change our perspective for cities being very far away.\r\n\r\nIn this approach, each change in depth is a change in scope executed using a special mode called `system:denser`. Each time this mode is introduced, the level of depth decreases one step toward `0`. The following is a simplified example of the resulting CSS when `sizes` is set to `3`:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n    --level: 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\n[mode~=\"system:denser\"] {\r\n    --level: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n[mode~=\"system:denser\"] [mode~=\"system:denser\"]{\r\n     --level: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated repeating selectors are used to indicate how deep the elements appear within the composition. The number of selectors for each declaration is used in the calculation to indicate the depth and compute the level.\r\n\r\nThese are accessible in the component architecture by using the boolean `denser` in a `box` or `box`-like component. This will automatically set the scope to be denser within that area.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction MoreDenseBox() {\r\n    return <box.div denser/>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember that a more dense box does not mean the box is larger. It means the elements within are smaller and more tightly packed.\r\n\r\n### Generating the Scale\r\n\r\nThe provided value for `--level` seen in the earlier example code will affect scale based calculations for `space` and `text` using the following forumla:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsize = min * pow(scale, level)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more about how this affects typography, see the [Typography docs](/docs/foundations-typography--docs).\r\n\r\n### Gap & Padding\r\n\r\nThe system uses only `gap` and `padding` as CSS properties wired into the `box` primitive. These are `boolean` and not configurable further past introducing the `denser` flag.\r\n\r\nThe **gap** value at `level: 0` equals the value provided by `minDimension`. The **padding** value is the next step above (ie., `0 + 1 = 1`) in the spacing scale. See example below for calculations using CSS custom property abbreviations:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.box-with-minimum-space {\r\n    --level: 0;\r\n    gap: calc(var(--min) * pow(var(--scale), var(--level)));\r\n    padding: calc(var(--min) * pow(var(--scale), var(--level) + 1));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe amount of space will increase at each level higher in depth, with a maximum level equal to the given `sizes` value. Adjusting the distance between steps is done by increasing the `$space_scaleFactor`.",

Rename the file however you like that aligns to your organizational preference. Note that the best naming conventions explain the purpose of using something over the hinting at the values within.\r\n\r\nEach generated `.yml` file will be prefilled with the token structure expected to fully cover an experience. This will also include metadata. The basic top-level setup for this file is as follows:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nmode: # The key to activate the the mode. `<box.div mode=\"my-mode\"/>`\r\nbrand: # A string that groups this within a single brand. If not set, this is considered \"symbolic\". See Color docs for more information.\r\nlang: # A string that represents the language where these values should be applied. (eg., en-US) Leaving this blank will apply the mode in all locales.\r\ntokens: # The token structure which requires curated values.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### How should `mode` be named?\r\n>\r\n> The `mode` key is important as it is meant to describe the use of this collection of values **across all brands**. This is not necessarily a unique identifier and could be shared across files that have a similar purpose. For example, you could create a mode that is meant to express the concept of premium (`mode: premium`). Then we could use that concept across pages, where each brand could have its own curated \"premium\" experience. For brands that don't have a concept of premium, the page would be styled in their default curation. Or more accurately, the next available mode found higher in the scope of hierarchy.\r\n>\r\n> **The mode shouldn't attempt to describe the visual style of the region.** It should be named to a purpose or intention for this new mode. The values within the mode will convey the presentation of that purpose.\r\n\r\nImportantly, **the file does not need to be completed as provided**. The recommended organization is to have separate modes for color, typography, and spacing. This is because color is more often experimented with than other styles.\r\n\r\n> #### Do I need to create separate files for light and dark mode?\r\n>\r\n> No, the system handles light and dark mode by mixing the system color with your given brand color with some amount of influence. The lightness or darkness is determined by the user's settings.\r\n>\r\n> You could force your provided color in place by setting `$influence` to `100` for any color token. This will ensure that your given color is the one used. This might be important for hyper-personalized settings where the user explicitly expects an appearance that is different from what the device normally provides. As an example, a user might prefer dark mode for most tasks, but specifically prefers light mode for reading articles.\r\n>\r\n> For more information about this approach, see the [Color docs](/docs/foundations-color--docs).\r\n\r\nThe schema should also help the curation process with intellisense within your code editor by using a YAML server extension.\r\n\r\nAfter a new mode is completed, run the following command to create the required assets to start using the new mode:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm run write:files\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates the associated `.css` file and updates the inventory of available modes for the Mode Manager to reference in the page lifecycle.\r\n\r\n### Mode Manager\r\n\r\nTo make the system work there is a script that writes resources meant for the `<head/>` of the document. The resources are initialized in the following manner:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { modeManager } from  './mode-manager.js';\r\n\r\nmodeManager({ /* options */ })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be called within the SSR process for the `<head/>` with the following options:\r\n\r\nThe `sizes` option determines the amount of sizes that this page is meant to display. For more information about this see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).\r\n\r\nThe `brand` option determines what brand to include in the page. This filters the possible modes that are expected to load to only the brand set. Without setting this value, the page would be presented as unbranded, using system and symbolic colors. Only one brand can be loaded. Brands omitted from this list will not be lazy loaded.\r\n\r\n> #### What if I want to support cobranding?\r\n> To keep the complexity of the system to a minimum, the system only accepts a single brand. However, the brand can be updated within the lifecycle. This means while only one brand can be present on the page, which brand this is can be switched at any time.\r\n>\r\n> To support cobranding, where the brands were expected would need to be defined similar to the way a mode is within the composition (eg., `data-brand=\"target\"`).\r\n\r\nThe `modes` option is an array of mode indentifier strings that should be loaded as soon as possible. This is to set the known modes that the page should present in its first load. The manager will also load modes as they appear within the HTML during the page lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe result of the manager will create several resources.\r\n\r\nThe manager will create a `<style/>` tag which serves two purposes:\r\n\r\n1. The CSS includes a node detection setup where as a node is introduced into the page, it triggers an imperceptable animation which is picked up by later scripts.\r\n2. When `sizes` is provided, additional CSS is written to support the given amount.\r\n\r\nThe manager will create a `<script/>` tag which serves a few purposes:\r\n\r\n1. The script will set up a Web Worker and a BroadcastChannel to communicate with the worker. The worker does most of the lookup and filtering of resources on a separate thread than the page.\r\n2. The script handles adding and removing `<link/>` tags that represent the mode CSS depending on the earlier setup and what modes appear over the lifecycle.\r\n3. The script listens for the aforementioned animation to fire on the qualifying selectors. When this occurs, a message is sent to the worker to potentially add a resource to the page.\r\n4. Once the network is idle and the connect is reasonable, there's one last call to retrieve the remaining modes for the given brand since we can expect that they might appear within the experience eventually.\r\n\r\nIf `modes` were provided, the script will also immediately write resources to the page. These will be `<link/>` tags similar to what will be written in later lifecycles. The difference is that the later script will not remove these. This means that if you set `brand` at the `modeManager`, this brand's resources will always be found on the page.",

      "text": "import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks';\r\n\r\n<Meta title=\"Foundations/Intents\" />\r\n\r\n# Intents\r\n\r\n**Intents** are a type of design token that have a strict definition and construction; they are _truly semantic_.\r\n\r\n> #### What is \"truly semantic\"?\r\n>\r\n> This is a difficult question to answer however, there are a few quailites that we can consider.\r\n> - **Semantic tokens avoid scales.** This is the \"smedium\" problem. You should be able to add and remove truly semantic tokens because they have very few relations to each other.\r\n> - **Semantic tokens are easily placed.** Finding a token called `$action_primary_backgroundColor` more clearly describes _where_ or _when_ the token is expected to be used. In contrast, the token `color.blue.500` does not convey any information about where or when it should be used.\r\n> - **\"Component Tokens\" are often highly specific semantic tokens.** A component token is describing the characteristics of a specific component. The best case scenario is generalizing these into categories for more reuse; which is the fundamental strategy behind intents.\r\n\r\n### Anatomy\r\n\r\nThe construction of an intent commonly has three (3) parts: **purpose, priority, property**. Each will start with a dollar-sign character (`$`) and be delimited by underscores (`_`).\r\n\r\n> #### Why use these characters?\r\n>\r\n> Both the `$` and `_` have been chosen for infrastructure purposes:\r\n> - The `$` indicates a variable to be used within the Sass ecosystem. This character is also valid to begin variables in the JavaScript ecosystem. This means it is valid in both.\r\n> - The `_` character allows the valid concatenation of the 3 parts that make up an intent. The dot (`.`) character is invalid in flavors of CSS while the hyphen (`-`) character is invalid when composing JavaScript variables.\r\n> This allows for a construction to be shared between Sass and JavaScript:\r\n> ```css\r\n> /* SCSS */\r\n> button.primary {\r\n>   color: tokens.$action_primary_foregroundColor;\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> ```jsx\r\n> /* JSX */\r\n> const style = { color: tokens.$action_primary_foregroundColor };\r\n> ```\r\n> The use of underscore characters also has the added benefit of keeping the file structure flat making processing of the intents easier to manage over a nested structure.\r\n\r\n#### Purpose\r\n\r\nThe first part of the intent name is the **purpose**, which is a generalized user interface concept with a known user expectation. There are four (4) main categories of purpose:\r\n\r\n- **surface** describes regions where content is placed. This covers modals, cards, dropdowns and even the whole page. These are commonly non-interactive.\r\n- **action** describes interactive content typically executed by the user with a tap or click; a canonical button.\r\n- **control** describes interactive regions where the user is expected to enter a value.\r\n- **text** describes all text using only font specific properties. Colors are associated with other above purposes.\r\n\r\n#### Priority\r\nAt first, the concept of **priority** seems to break the first quality of being semantic; including a scale. However, in this model, the scale is describing the importance of the user interface concept to the user. There are three (3) levels of priority:\r\n\r\n- **primary** describes the most important thing that the user should read or interact with on the page. For text, these are headlines. For actions, these are primary buttons. For surfaces, these are typically modals or other treatments meant to strictly focus the user's attention in a modal-like way.\r\n- **secondary** describes the next most important thing after primary. For text, this is body copy. For actions, these are the secondary buttons. For surfaces, these are regions created for flyouts as the user has deliberately chosen to interact with these apart from the rest of the experience when they exist.\r\n- **auxiliary** describes less important things. For text, this is detail for help messages or legal copy. For buttons, these are the most simply designed but also most commonly found in an experience. For surfaces, this describes the body of the page and its stylistic properties.\r\n\r\nNote that **auxiliary does not mean default**. This is especially the case for text. What is considered the default priority for component usage depends on the purpose. In the case of the `text` component, the default is secondary. This is because the body copy is expected to be more common than smaller details for passive information.\r\n\r\n> #### What about priority for control?\r\n>\r\n> The control category doesn't include priority levels because user input isn't seen with priority; all controls are equally important. You may argue that an input showing an error state is more important than another without, however we'll handle this treatment in another way.\r\n\r\n#### Property\r\n\r\nFrom here, the last part describes the stylistic property being changed. The available properties depend on the category but in general, the **surface**, **action**, and **control** categories handle properties like color, rounding, and stroke. The **text** category handles all font related properties. In most cases, these are directly related to CSS properties. In fact, the construction of an intent is similar to CSS declaration syntax.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* purpose.priority */\r\nbutton.primary {\r\n    /* property */\r\n    background-color: blue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### What about state?\r\n>\r\n> States such as `:disabled` or `:hover` are handled with changes internal to the system and its components. This is to reduce the amount of curation required to assign values to all the intents. Especially values which are less frequently seen.\r\n>\r\n> For the concept of `:disabled`, the component is presented at `opacity: .4` and `cursor: not-allowed`. For buttons, the concept of `:hover` is handled by mixing the given background and foreground colors by a small percentage to show feedback to the user, along with `cursor: pointer`.\r\n>\r\n> The concept of `:invalid` is handled differently since it is considered of an expression that doesn't change the functionality of the page (ie., `:disabled`), nor is it trigged directly by the user (ie., `:hover`). This is conveyed by using `data-mode=\"system:critical\"` on the region in a critical state. Some components, such as the [`lockup`](docs/primitives-lockup--docs) will internally set this when other configurations are provided.\r\n>\r\n> The concept of `:selected` is potentially the most controversial in the system. The treatment in the system provides an accented colored bottom border for chosen items. This is demonstrated in the [`listbox`](/docs/primitives-listbox--docs) and related components. The reason for this choice is due to the challenge of reducing the number of intents while conveying a different state. Updating the background color for an interactive item to represent selection alone could indicate a new primary button treatment. The bottom border treatment was chosen for its uniqueness in the system.\r\n>\r\n> As part of the exercise in validating the decision behind the `:selected` treatment, it was identified that only `<Button priority='auxiliary'/>` will expect to be given the `:selected` treatment. No other button priority is meant to show selection. Most other components have clear visual changes for selection (eg., [`<Checkbox/>`](/docs/components-checkbox--docs)). An outlier is [`<Calendar/>`](/docs/components-calendar--docs) which cannot host additional accessories to represent selection. The `<Calendar/>` component uses `<Button/>` elements to create interactive cells.\r\n\r\n#### Examples of intents\r\n\r\n- `$text_primary_fontFamily` describes the font family for headlines.\r\n- `$action_secondary_borderColor` describes the border color for secondary buttons.\r\n- `$control_backgroundColor` describes the background color for input fields.\r\n- `$surface_auxiliary_foregroundColor` describes the color of body copy and icons.\r\n\r\n### Additional intents\r\n\r\nThere are other categories of intents that should be addressed for completeness.\r\n\r\n#### Figure\r\n\r\nThe **figure** category has a purpose which describes regions of the same concept meant to be visually segregated (eg., charts, illustrations, default avatar colors, syntax highlighting, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe tokens in this category have no meaning past segregated color. In other words, the first slice of a pie chart is too specific of a concept to have a token named for it. Instead, we provide a collection of tokens meant to cover this regions generally where they are identified using a scale. This is appropriate because the meaning of the color being used isn't attached to the region. The region doesn't have meaning past existing as a colored region next to other colored regions.\r\n\r\nAn example of a figure color token is `$figure_rank1_color`. While this does follow the general anatomy of the common intents, there are some slight differences.\r\n\r\nThe priority is less about importance to the user, and more about how frequently we expect to see this color in the region. Imagine a color-by-number book where the colors are ranked in terms of expected frequency of use for the entire book. We then use that ranking to assign the numbers to the regions where we expect the color.\r\n\r\nThe property of color is used to ambiguate the use. For cases such as charts and illustrations, it is possible that the color is used for a background fill. For syntax highlighing, this could be used as the text color.\r\n\r\n> #### Is it appropriate for the same set of colors to be used for all these regions?\r\n>\r\n> Possibly not. The general idea is that there will be a set of branded colors that an organization will want to included in visual regions within the experience. In the event more fine-tuned decisions need to be made for these regions, component tokens could be introduced as `$chart_rank1_color` and `$avatar_rank1_color`.\r\n\r\n#### Space & Density\r\n\r\nThe **space** category is unique since is meant to convey the intention of relationships using the void between objects, not affecting the objects themselves. This category has only two intents:\r\n\r\n- `$space_minDimension` describes the smallest amount of space that will exist within the experience.\r\n- `$space_scaleFactor` describes the rate in which the spacing scale will increase.\r\n\r\nThe resulting amount of space is further determined by a formula using the depth of the current scope. For more about this technique, see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).\r\n\r\n### Curating values\r\n\r\nThe act of selecting values to associate with an intent is called **curation**. As described earlier, the name of the intent should provide a clear indication about where or when the token is meant to be used within an experience, typically a group of similar components or user expectations.\r\n\r\nThis section will mention parts of intents that are less immediately clear.\r\n\r\n#### foregroundColor\r\n\r\nThe concept of `foregroundColor` is meant to cover **text and icons**. You can consider both of these collections of glyphs which align to having the same color between them. This is similar to setting `<svg fill=\"currentColor\"/>` to inherit the text color in code. This is included in surface, action, and control categories.\r\n\r\nWhen curating the `foregroundColor` you should consider this decision along with the `backgroundColor` for the current intent. For example, the `$action_primary_foregroundColor` **should always exist** on top of the `$action_primary_backgroundColor`. As an incorrect example, the `$ACTION_secondary_foregroundColor` **should not exist** on top of a `$SURFACE_secondary_backgroundColor` as they are in separate categories of intents. This connection exists for accessibility; to ensure adequate contrast with each pairing.\r\n\r\nYou should also consider the `borderColor` with this set as well, but is less critical from an accessibility standpoint. Best practice is to work on curating each set at a time; all `action.primary` colors, then all `action.secondary` colors and so on.\r\n\r\n#### minDimension, minRem, & scaleFactor\r\n\r\nThe text and space categories compute sizing scales for their respective purposes. In order to create these scales we need two numbers, a starting point and exponential growth from that point to create the scale. The formula looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsize = min * pow(scale, level)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the `level` is determined by the number of sizes. For more on this value, see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).\r\n\r\nThe `minDimension` expects a value with a unit such as `8px` or `.5rem` to use as the base for further scale calculations. The minimum is used to ensure that the resulting value is never smaller than expected.\r\n\r\nThe `minRem` represents the smallest font size for that category of text in terms of `rem`. This means expecting to curate a value of `20px` would be expected as `minRem: 1.5` (eg., `1.5rem`).\r\n\r\n> #### Why not use `minDimension` for consistency?\r\n>\r\n> To complete the necessary calculations for the text category, every number provided needs to unitless as CSS `calc()` functions can't make unitless ratios from division operations. This may be possible in the future, in which case `minRem` will be replaced with `minDimension`.\r\n\r\nThe `scaleFactor` is used to create the exponential scale of values for the category to choose from. For more about how this works for typography, see the [Typography docs](docs/foundations-typography--docs). For more about how this works for space, see the [Density docs](/docs/foundations-density--docs).",

Transmitting the right message to your audience is key toward providing a encouraging experience for the user.\r\n\r\n### Abbreviations\r\nEnsure that abbreviations aren't tailored to a specific audience unless the abbreviation has been well-defined prior to use within context of the message. For example, abbreviating new technologies should first be defined before use. Abbreviations with measurement units can be used with an assumption that they exist as common knowledge.\r\n\r\n### Jargon\r\nWhen using unfamiliar words or concepts, put the word in quotations and then define the word soon after in a following sentence. Otherwise, attempt to avoid technical language unless it is directed at a specific audience. Aim to be clear with the message by using common language where possible. Consider simplifying or providing analogies.\r\n\r\n### Lists\r\nWhen providing guidance by categorizing items together, consider using a list. Use a numbered list if the order of the items is important, otherwise a list using a symbol marking the item from body text is appropriate. Use a leading sentence to describe what is expected within the list. Do not indent the list more than twice; consider creating a separate list with leading text instead. Attempt to craft each item similarly to the others.\r\n\r\n### Files, folders, and urls\r\nWhen referencing a file by name, ensure it matches exactly to how it would be found within the operating system. Include the file extension or describe the type of file by the application expected to open it. If expecting a user to traverse a system, be clear in technical commands. Do not assume the user knows what any one command means. Offer both graphical user interface guidance as well as command-line interface commands when possible, depending on the audience.\r\n\r\nWhen providing a url, do not include the protocol (`https://`) or subdomain (`www`) unless the resource is inaccessible without it. If the url can be shortened, consider this for better accessibility where the url may not be interactive; when printed for example.\r\n\r\n### Nouns\r\nProper nouns are captialized in writing styles which include the differentiation of glyphs. Unless the style of the text is altered to signify a different context. In this design system, large headings have no capitalization while smaller headings, actions, labels are all uppercase.\r\n\r\n### Punctuation\r\nUse proper punctuation in bodies of text, using proper localized methods. Headings, labels, and actions. Helping and error text for form inputs are also punctuated.",

In many cases, you can think of them as super-charged HTML elements.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, primitives aren't expected to be used on their own but instead as a part of a larger composition. For example the `input` primitive is practically invisible itself. The more appropriate choice for displaying a user input is to use the `field` primitive and add the `input` primitive as a child.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<field.div>\r\n    <input.text/>\r\n</field.div>\r\n```\r\nSee visual examples in the [Field component docs](/docs/components-field--docs).\r\n\r\n> #### Why use the dot-notation syntax?\r\n>\r\n> While many systems will opt to use the `as` prop to inform the internal tag name\r\n> (eg., `<Box as='main'/>`), I've found that the syntax made popular by\r\n> [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) is more clear as affecting\r\n> the tag name since it is directly connected. This also encourages the user to select\r\n> the most semantic HTML element instead of needing to remember to add a prop to change it.\r\n>\r\n> Resources that use the dot-notation syntax to choose the HTML element are lowercase (eg., `<box.div/>`) while those which do not because they have been semantically curated are uppercase (eg., `<Close/>` is always a button).\r\n\r\n### Priniciples\r\n\r\n- Elements should be composable such that no additional styles need to be declared.\r\n- Authors cannot add `id`, `class`, or `style` attributes to any component. These are handled internally to the library as needed and are removed if provided.\r\n\r\n> #### Why choose React over Web Components?\r\n>\r\n> While I am a proponent of web components for their style encapsulation and focus on native \r\n> DOM methods, the compositional aspect is lacking.\r\n>\r\n> As an example, in order to create a button \r\n> using web components, you'd either need to update the custom tag to make it semantic through \r\n> additional attributes or wrap the existing button in a component. Both cases are undesirable \r\n> from a maintenance perspective. In React, we can have a component alias (ie., `<Button/>`) \r\n> that renders the native `<button/>` element. If [component built-ins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/is) were widely available, \r\n> then this would be a more difficult decision.\r\n\r\n### Gallery\r\n\r\n<Grid>\r\n    <Example stories={ BoxStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ CloseStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ FieldStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ FlyoutStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ IconStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ InputStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ ListboxStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ LocalizeStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ LockupStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ MediaStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ TextStories }/>\r\n    <Example stories={ TrackStories }/>\r\n</Grid>",

Read on if you'd like to learn how the final resulting values are determined.\r\n\r\n### Tokens\r\n\r\nAll typographic tokens are underneath the `text` category in intents. Each token is subdivided by a priority (ie., `primary`, `secondary`, `auxiliary`). Example: `$text_primary_fontWeight` describes a headline's font weight.\r\n\r\nPriorities are linked to their use within the experience. `primary` is equal to the concept of headlines as they are expected to be the most important content to capture the user's interest before moving to lower priorty content. `secondary` describes most body content and `auxiliary` describes details you might find in help or error messaging and legal text.\r\n\r\nEach category has tokens that can be curated for the following properties:\r\n\r\n- `fontFamily`\r\n- `fontWeight`\r\n- `lineHeight`\r\n- `minRem` (related to font size)\r\n- `scaleFactor` (related to font size)\r\n\r\n### Generating the Scale\r\n\r\nThe system creates a scale for each category using the `minRem` and `scaleFactor` values. In most cases, the result is aligned to what a person might find when using [typescale.com](https://typescale.com/). One clear difference being `minRem` expecting a unitless value of `rem`. For example, if the intention for the minimum font size for a category is `16px`, the value for this token would be `1` (ie., `1rem = 16px`).\r\n\r\n> #### Why expect the minimum font size?\r\n>\r\n> This is to ensure that any resulting calculation of text is accessible as it will always be larger than this number.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it `minRem` and not something else?\r\n>\r\n> In order to compute fluid sizes for `primary` text, we use unitless numbers to calculate ratios in CSS. It is much harder to remove units from calculations than it is to later include them. To reduce exceptions based on category, all text tokens has the same composition.\r\n> \r\n> Once units can be removed from CSS calculations, this should be changed to align with `minDimension` instead.\r\n\r\nSizes are generated using the following formula:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsize = minRem * pow(scaleFactor, level)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `level` is determined from [the amount of sizes](/docs/foundations-density--docs) expected to occur in the experience. This means at the most compact parts of the experience (`level: 0`), the resulting font size will be `minRem * 1rem`. Each level up will scale up the size by the given `scaleFactor`. Here's what this would look like with `minRem: 1`, `scaleFactor: 1.125`, with 4 sizes:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nlevel0 = 1 * 1.125^0 = 1.000 # 1rem\r\nlevel1 = 1 * 1.125^1 = 1.125 # 1.125rem\r\nlevel2 = 1 * 1.125^2 = 1.265 # 1.265rem\r\nlevel3 = 1 * 1.125^3 = 1.424 # 1.414rem\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the resulting font size is determined by `level`, font size changes for any category occur only at density changes. This allows for page hero areas at `level: 3` to have the possibility of having larger text than what is found in dense tables at `level: 0`.\r\n\r\n> #### Why not add more tokens for explicit font sizes?\r\n>\r\n> The average amount of font sizes for public design systems is 12. In reality, we don't need to curate lots of font sizes, this is too many choices ([Hick's Law](https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/)). We aim to maintain a hierarchy of importance through these sizes. This is conveyed specifically with the `priority` divisions. With 4 levels you would have 12 font sizes available; 3 kinds of text multiplied by 4 sizes.\r\n\r\n### Fluid Primary Text\r\n\r\nThe `primary` category used for headlines is a bit special as we expect the size of the text to adjust based on the available size of the device. To do this, we follow the conventions explained [here](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/), specifically the section explaining avoiding reflow. The result is the headline resizing smoothly between two thresholds, maintaining the general optical composition throughout.\r\n\r\n<Canvas of={ Priority }/>\r\n\r\nThe two thresholds are `320px` at a minimum representing the smallest device widths and `480px` at a maximum.\r\n\r\n> #### What does `480px` represent?\r\n>\r\n> This comes from the optimal line length for body copy, which has many debatable ranges for the best amount of characters for readability. The majority of these ranges will include 60 characters, which is roughly equal to `60rch` or `30rem`, which is `480px`. There doesn't seem to be data on the optimal line length for headlines, so to relate headlines with body copy, this upper-bound is used.\r\n>\r\n> More research can be done to adjust this maximum as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis minimum and maximum dimensions are then used with the `$text_primary_minSize` and `$text_primary_scaleFactor` to determine the maximum primary font size, (ie., the headline font size when the viewport is `480px` or larger). Further calculations are completed to determine how the text scales between `320px` and `480px` in a smooth linear progression. More detail is found at the earlier post. In the implementation here, the `320px` and `480px` are translated in terms of unitless `rem` before finally being used in the `clamp()` CSS function and assigned appropriate units.\r\n\r\n> #### How do I render other text styles?\r\n>\r\n> You can render other styles of text by using their appropriate HTML elements.\r\n> - `<strong/>` can emphasize text by making it <strong>bolder</strong>.\r\n> - `<em/>` can emphasize text by making it <em>italic</em>.\r\n> - `<s/>` can emphasize text by adding a <s>strikethrough</s>.\r\n>\r\n> The `text` element can render any of these elements with the dot-notation syntax (eg., `<text.strong/>`).",

Some of the approaches found within these pages are highly experimental but remain as a proof of concept for organization and composition of resources within our practice.\r\n\r\nThe design system...\r\n\r\n- Supports designing with intentions, not arbitrary feelings.\r\n- Invokes deliberate restrictions for the purpose of reducing decisions.\r\n- Should aim to fill gaps produced by wireframing and user flows.\r\n- Provides guidance for implementing common patterns and themes.\r\n\r\nWe believe that proper adoption of a design system suggests a trustworthy experience to the user. If parts of a user flow deviate from expectations with novel concepts, the user will lose trust and patience in the system unless prompted. It is imperative that user expectations are met from the smallest tokens and components which are the foundations to our larger experiences.\r\n\r\n> #### New paradigm shifts\r\n>\r\n> Look out for this visual treatment, it often provides clarity to a newly introduced concept.\r\n\r\nUser discretion is advised. 😊\r\n\r\n{/* <Button priority='primary'>Get started!</Button> */}",
